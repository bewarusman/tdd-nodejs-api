# TDD Node.js API
TDD which stands for test driven development is a way of building software applications. This approach adds extra complexity to the process. Developer has to write extra code - test cases. TDD makes sure that the piece of code is doing the required task before releasing. It makes sure the code can be changed easily as business requirement tends to change. The process consists of three main steps: Writing failing tests, writing code that satisfies tests and refactoring.
